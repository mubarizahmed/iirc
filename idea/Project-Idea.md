The following are some of our project ideas:

### 1. Universal Infrared Remote Controller
A universal IR remote controller that will be able to control any device that used Infrared code as a mode of control. The remote will have controls such as Volume Up/Down, Channel Up/Down etc. 

### 2. Smart BMS
A smart BMS for a specific battery layout. It will provide the ability for voltage balancing, over/under discharge protection as well as have the possibility of monitoring the overall system remotely.

### 3. Activities Tracker
A motion tracker to track sporting activities. It will be able to track a range of gestures (swings, bounces, jumps, etc.) and count them. Additionally it could stream to mobile app such as Phyphox.

### 4. Smart Keychain
An IoT enabled keychain that can be located and tracked. Additionally, it will have a buzzer to help users locate it.
