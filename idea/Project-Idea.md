The following are some of our project ideas:

### 1. Universal Infrared Remote Controller
A universal IR remote controller that will be able to control any device that used Infrared code as a mode of control. The remote will have controls such as Volume Up/Down, Channel Up/Down etc. 

### 2. Smart BMS
A smart BMS for a specific battery layout. It will provide the ability for voltage balancing, over/under discharge protection as well as have the possibility of monitoring the overall system remotely.
